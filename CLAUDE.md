# CLAUDE.md — Widget Studio

Home-screen widget builder for iOS 17+ (native Swift / SwiftUI) and Android (Kotlin, Compose, Glance; M7, ADR-025). Arabic default (RTL) + English. Every widget is a **spec JSON + optional user image**, drawn by one renderer shared by the app preview and the widget. Templates are bundled; an optional AI flow uses the user's own key (BYOK). No backend, no accounts, no analytics. App Store later.

**Install method (owner, every build since M0):** every IPA is installed with **Fast Store**, a paid signing store that re-signs the app and the widget extension with its own certificate and profile. No Sideloadly. The store decides bundle IDs, team, profile and entitlements (the App Group was not granted in the M0 or M2 tests), so never assume the compiled values at runtime (ADR-004) and check Diagnostics → Signing when a capability fails.

The product brief is `widget-app-brief.md` (template catalog: `TEMPLATES.md`, visual reference: `docs/reference/widgets-reference.jpg`). Read them before changing behavior. Decisions live in `docs/decisions.md`.

## Product rules (permanent, ADR-028)
They apply to EVERY design, now and in the future (templates, AI results, imports, edits), on both platforms.
- **LIVE:** anything that can change (time, dates, progress, %, levels, counts, names, media, weather, tasks, states) is bound to real data. No frozen values.
- **INTERACTIVE:** anything that looks tappable (button, switch, slider, checkbox, tile, play icon) does something real, or shows a clear hint if the OS forbids it.
- **ALIVE:** anything that expresses a mood, illustration, icon or color that would naturally differ by state (battery, weather, day/night, done/not done, playing/paused, on/off, goal reached) has variants chosen by real data.
- **CORRECT:** values and visuals agree (lit dots match the %, the icon matches the condition, the label matches the binding).

Enforced as a system, never by special cases:
- **Prompt:** every prompt version carries these rules and asks per element "what does it show, what happens on tap, how does it look in other states?"
- **Post-pass:** `DesignRules.swift` / `DesignRules.kt` hold generic detectors (unbound changing values, controls without actions, mood or illustration layers without states, value/visual mismatches). `AutoWire` fixes what it safely can; the rest is listed in the Interactive summary. Both run `Fixtures/DesignRules/vectors.json`.
- **Catalog:** built-in state sets live in `capabilities.json` (`stateSets`), so the AI, the post-pass and the editor reuse them. Adding a set needs no prompt edit.
- **Eval:** every case is scored on live, interactive, alive and correct; CI fails if any metric drops below its best recorded run (`docs/ai-eval/wiring-best.json`).
- **Templates:** every template passes `DesignRules` with no finding (`TemplateRulesTests`, `DesignRulesTest`).

## Working rules
- **Commit after every finished step** and push (`origin` = github.com/KhaledZaki1919/widget-studio, branch `main`). Small commits; end messages with the `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` line.
- Work in the milestones of the brief §10 (M0…M7). Stop at the end of each milestone and tell the owner the IPA is ready and how to test it; the next milestone starts in a new conversation.
- Record decisions as short ADRs in `docs/decisions.md`. Keep this file current.
- Git identity for this repo: `Khaled <khaled96960@gmail.com>` (repo-local config).
- Run `bash scripts/secret-scan.sh` before every push (the repo is public). `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` installs it as a pre-push hook.

## Repository map
| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `ios/project.yml` | XcodeGen spec (app + widget extension + tests). Never hand-edit the generated `.xcodeproj` |
| `ios/WidgetStudio/` | App target: `App/` (entry, root), `Features/<Area>/` (Tasks: `TasksView`, `TasksModel`, Reminders-backed tab, ADR-028; Library: tab, detail with Customize, previews; Editor: editor + field controls, layer editor (`LayersView`, `LayerDetailView`; ADR-022); MyWidgets: saved designs, `DesignsModel`; Settings: `LiveDataModel` (real data for previews), settings, dhikr list, Shortcut guide; AI: Settings → AI, Create from image flow with the crop step (`CropView`) and Create all (ADR-024), Use another AI (`ExternalAIView`, ADR-023), error messages (ADR-018); Qibla: live compass; Tiles: `TilesModel`, tile setup screens (ADR-017); Diagnostics with TestSpecs and data sources, opened only by long-pressing the version; Editor also has `StatesSettings` (States panel, ADR-028); Onboarding: introduction and `LogoMark`), `Resources/` |
| `ios/WidgetStudioWidgets/` | Widget extension: `SpecWidget.swift` (one `StaticConfiguration` widget per template, `TemplateWidget<ID>`, picked by swiping the widget gallery; error text instead of gray; step log — ADR-013), `ProbeWidget` (check widget; large shows the step log). **No AppIntentConfiguration**: it never renders on the owner's Fast Store install (ADR-013). A new template needs a `TemplateIDs` entry and a line in its category bundle |
| `ios/WidgetStudioTests/` | App-hosted unit tests: font availability, RTL invariants, every spec through the widget view, snapshots (`Snapshots/<id>.<lang>.png`) |
| `ios/WidgetStudioUITests/` | Simulator UI smoke tests |
| `ios/Fonts/` | Doto (static instances), IBM Plex Sans Arabic, Patrick Hand, DM Serif Display, Bebas Neue and the Arabic fallbacks Aref Ruqaa, Amiri, Lalezar, all OFL; bundled in app and widget, declared in `UIAppFonts` (ADR-010, ADR-019) |
| `ios/WidgetKitCore/` | Swift package shared by app + extension: `Environment/` (App Group resolver, profile, code signature reader), `Probe/` (incl. `WidgetLog`), `Data/` (live data: `OpenMeteo`, `PrayerCalculator` (adhan-swift), `HealthSummary`/`HealthReader`, `CounterState`/`StopwatchState`, `DataCache`, `AppSettings`, `LiveData`, `HealthExtras`, `Markets` (ADR-029), `SourceStatus`, `PlaceNames` — ADR-016; `ClockFormat`, `QiblaCompass`, `TileSetup` — ADR-017), `AI/` (BYOK client ported from Lakhas: providers, `StructuredAI`, `AIDeadline`, `AIService`, Keychain key store, settings + consent; `AI/Widget/`: prompt builder, AI schema, parser, `WidgetGenerator`, `AIImage` — ADR-018; review round, `SpecSnapshot` renders — ADR-019; `AIColorTokens`, `AILayoutFix` (the last answer's overlaps fixed locally, never no widget) — ADR-022; `ExternalAI` (instructions + JSON import) — ADR-023; `WidgetDetector` (Vision: widget outlines, card shapes, crop, wallpaper color) — ADR-024; `AutoWireRules`, `DesignRules` (the four product rules) — ADR-028; `AISchemaReference` (the readable schema for Use another AI), `parseAll` (several widgets) — ADR-029), `Resources/Spec/ai/` (system prompt, schemas, import example exported for Android; `AIExportTests` fails when stale, fresh copies in `package-renders/ai-export`), `Prompts/` (`generate_v7.md` in use (ADR-029: limits, card canvas, 1.4 × cap height, several widgets; catalog section generated), `review_v1.md`; v1–v6 kept), `Designs/` (`SavedDesign`, `SharedStore` = the only storage for designs and photos, `DesignEditing` rules, `LayerEditing` (path-based layer operations, ADR-022), `ImageProcessing`), `Spec/` (`SpecDrawing.swift`: card, chart, spans, arc path, gradients — ADR-029; models incl. `calendarMonth`/`list`/`progressBar` in `CalendarListProgress.swift`, `stack`/`spacer` in `Stack.swift`, `states` in `States.swift`, `SpecLayout` (overlap rule), bindings, validator, icon whitelist, test spec loader), `Render/` (SpecView, layer views, `DrawingViews.swift` (shape geometry, chart, arc text, spans), `TimeWords`, binding resolver, fonts, timelines, `AccentedRendering` — Tinted/Clear home screens, ADR-023), `Resources/` (Templates: the Mono library, TestSpecs, Spec schema); `TemplateLibrary` loads templates. **Unit tests live here** |
| `ios/Config/` | Entitlements (written by XcodeGen from `project.yml`) |
| `ios/scripts/` | `build-ipa.sh`, `check-strings.py`, `pick-simulator.py` |
| `scripts/secret-scan.sh` | Secret scan, run before push and in CI |
| `docs/ai-eval/` | AI eval set: drawn widgets + `cases.json`; workflow **AI eval** (`.github/workflows/ai-eval.yml`, manual; secrets `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) runs several comma-separated models per run and uploads side-by-side renders, `<case>.fix.png` for local layout fixes and a comparison table (ADR-019, ADR-022); results in `docs/ai-eval/results/`. Never commit crops of the reference image |
| `docs/` | `decisions.md` (ADRs), `capabilities.md` (table generated from the catalog: `node scripts/capabilities-table.mjs`), `progress.md`, `reference/` (gitignored image), `app-store/` (listing, privacy label, review notes, screenshots, `when-account.md` — ADR-020) |
| `android/` | Android app (M7, ADR-025, ADR-026; progress and differences from iOS in `docs/android-progress.md`): `app/src/main/java/com/khaled/widgetstudio/` with `spec/` (model, parser, `SpecWriter`, bindings, sample data, template library), `design/` (`SavedDesign`, `DesignStore`, `SpecValidator`, `LayerEditing`, `AILayoutFix`, image processing), `data/` (live data: weather, adhan prayer times, Health Connect, battery, tasbeeh, tasks, refresh worker; `Extras.kt`: health extras, air quality, screen time, earbuds, markets, app icons — ADR-029), `ai/` (Gemini client and Keystore key, prompt from the Swift export, parser, `WidgetDetector`, Use another AI), `render/` (Canvas renderer: `SpecRenderer`, `TextDrawer`, `ChartDrawer`, `StackLayout`, `Drawing2.kt` (shapes, chart, dot grid options, ADR-029), fonts, icons), `widget/` (Glance widget, actions, `TapLog`, tiles, configuration screen, minute ticker), `ui/` (app shell and library, editor, layers, create from image, settings, onboarding, Qibla, Tasks, Diagnostics). Templates, test specs, schema, prompts, fonts, the icon whitelist and the catalog order are copied from the iOS tree by Gradle at build time, never duplicated. Tests in `app/src/test` (parsing; Robolectric renders beside the iOS snapshots) |
| `site/` | Privacy policy and support pages (ar/en), deployed to GitHub Pages by `pages.yml` (ADR-020) |

## Environment
- Development machine is **Windows**; there is no Mac. iOS builds and tests run **only in GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ios.yml`, `macos-15`; the IPA and the job "Compile with Xcode 27" run on `xcode-27`, ADR-030).
- Node.js is at `C:\Program Files\nodejs` (no Python locally; CI has `python3`).
- GitHub CLI is at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`.
- Android CI: `.github/workflows/android.yml` (Ubuntu, Gradle 8.14 via setup-gradle, no wrapper JAR). Since ADR-029 a local toolchain exists (JDK 17, Gradle 8.14.3, SDK 36 in `C:/Users/khale/widget-tools`): `bash scripts/android-local.sh :app:testDebugUnitTest` compiles and runs the unit tests in about 2 minutes. With `PRIVATE_EVAL=<dir>` it also runs `PrivateEvalTest` on the owner's private images.
- **Private images:** `private-eval/` (the owner's test images) and `private-eval-out/` (anything made from them) are git-ignored. Never commit, upload or put them in CI artifacts.
- OpenSSL is available in Git Bash (set `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` for `-subj` arguments).

## Commands
iOS (CI only; locally you can only edit), from `ios/`:
```
xcodegen generate                         # WidgetStudio.xcodeproj
swift test --package-path WidgetKitCore
python3 scripts/check-strings.py          # fails on missing ar/en translations or unknown keys
swiftlint lint
```
**CI** (`ios.yml`), on push to `main`, PRs and manual runs:
1. **every push:** secret scan + localization check + compile-only build (all errors, full `xcodebuild.log` artifact), and `WidgetKitCore` unit tests (`swift test`);
2. **only when the head commit message contains `[full]` or `[ipa]`** (or a manual run): app tests on the Simulator (renders, RTL invariants, snapshots, every template through the widget view) + UI smoke tests; every render goes to the `snapshots` artifact;
3. **only with `[ipa]`** (or a manual run), after everything above is green: unsigned IPA → artifact `WidgetStudio-ipa` (30 days). `build-ipa.sh` fails if the app or the widget lacks the App Group entitlement or a font declared in `UIAppFonts`.

Docs-only commits (`**.md`, `docs/**`) skip CI. SwiftLint is a separate, non-blocking job. Superseded runs are cancelled.

**Android CI (`android.yml`, ADR-025):** every push touching `android/**` or the shared spec files runs the unit tests (parsing; all templates rendered in ar/en beside the iOS snapshots, artifact `android-renders`) and a debug build. `[apk]` in the head commit message (or a manual run) also builds the signed release APK and `.aab` (artifact `WidgetStudio-android`). The keystore exists only in repository secrets and the owner's backup (`C:\Users\khale\Documents\WidgetStudio-signing\`); never commit or print it. One APK per Android phase (A1–A5).

**Build modes (ADR-014):** one Swift condition, `WS_DEVELOPER`, set through the build setting `WS_EXTRA_CONDITIONS` (`project.yml`, empty by default).
- **Store mode** (default, what CI ships): the 37 fixed template widgets + one "My widget" per size reading `SharedStore`. Works on the owner's Fast Store install without an App Group or AppIntents.
- **Developer mode** (with the owner's own Apple account, later): the configurable widget (Edit Widget picks any saved design or template, Appearance, search). CI only *compiles* it (job "Compile", step "Build developer mode"); it never ships an IPA from CI.
- **Switching to developer mode later:**
  1. In `ios/project.yml`, set `WS_EXTRA_CONDITIONS: "WS_DEVELOPER"` (or pass `WS_EXTRA_CONDITIONS=WS_DEVELOPER` to `xcodebuild`).
  2. Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic` for the account, and register the App Group `group.com.khaled.widgetstudio` for the app and the widget extension.
  3. Build and sign with Xcode or a signing CI job (not the unsigned IPA job).
  4. Check Diagnostics → App Group says Shared ✓ before testing My widget.

**Build rule (owner, since M2):**
- Do **not** build an IPA after each fix. Commit each fix and push; that runs compile + unit tests only. Fix all errors per commit.
- Use `[full]` on a commit when the change needs the Simulator tests (rendering, UI); it never builds an IPA.
- Build the IPA **once**, with `[ipa]` in the commit message, only after **all** requested fixes are done and every test is green. Then tell the owner the IPA is ready; they test everything in one go.

**After each push:**
1. Poll the run in the **foreground**, at most ~5 minutes per call, with a bounded loop of short calls: `for i in $(seq 1 9); do s=$(gh run view <id> --json status --jq .status); [ "$s" = completed ] && break; sleep 20; done`. Do **not** use `gh run watch`: Git Bash's `timeout` can't stop the Windows `gh.exe`, so it overran three times. Never start a background watcher (low-memory PC).
2. Fetch logs in a **separate call**, never chained after a watch: `gh run view <id> --log-failed` (or `--job <id> --log`).
3. On failure, fix **all** errors in one commit, push, and watch again until green.

## Conventions
**Swift / iOS**
- Swift 5 language mode, minimal concurrency checking (ADR-006), iOS 17+, SwiftUI. No third-party UI libraries or AI SDKs.
- Never hand-edit `.pbxproj`; change `project.yml`. Generated `Info.plist`s and the `.xcodeproj` are gitignored.
- No force unwraps or force casts.
- **No duplicate file names** within a Swift module.
- **Strings:** every user-facing string comes from a String Catalog (`Localizable.xcstrings` per target, `InfoPlist.xcstrings`) with both `ar` and `en`. Keys are `area.name` (`diag.title`); prefixes are listed in `ios/scripts/check-strings.py`, so add new areas there. Values that aren't UI text use `Text(verbatim:)`.
- **Accessibility identifiers** start with `ax.` (`ax.diag.run`).
- **Layout:** leading/trailing only; test RTL and LTR.
- **RTL in specs (ADR-010):** never flip anything like an image and never set `layoutDirection` on a `List`/UIKit-backed view to preview Arabic. Inside `SpecView` only `mirror: true` layers change: position, alignment, item order. Glyphs, digits and clocks keep their shape.
- **Fonts (ADR-010):** reference bundled fonts by PostScript name only (`FontRegistry`); every font file goes in `ios/Fonts` and both `UIAppFonts` lists. No runtime registration, no CoreText variation fonts.
- **One spec, two renderers (ADR-025):** any spec change (layer type, field, binding, background) updates the Swift model and renderer *and* the Kotlin ones (`android/.../spec`, `render/`), and both test suites. Android reads the shared files; never copy them into `android/`.
- **Templates (ADR-011):** one JSON per template in `Resources/Templates/<id>.json`, colors as tokens (`@bg`, `@fg`, `@accent`…), every visible text `{en, ar}`, and `catalogOrder` in `TemplateLibrary` updated. Spec extensions (`when`, `rotation`, `highlightColor`, `icon` fields, new bindings) are listed in ADR-011.
- **Tinted/Clear home screens (ADR-023):** every layer view reads `specAccented` and draws its accented variant (no large solid fills, chromatic colors `widgetAccentable`, photos desaturated). A new layer type needs one too; `RenderSnapshotTests` (package, every push) fails on solid blocks and uploads `package-renders`.
- **Snapshots:** an intended visual change means re-recording references from the `snapshots` artifact (`ios/WidgetStudioTests/Snapshots/README.md`); look at the renders before committing them.
- **Sideloading (ADR-004):** never hardcode the bundle ID, team prefix or App Group at runtime. Use `AppGroupResolver.resolve()`. The widget extension never calls the network for AI and never reads the Keychain.
- **Release (ADR-020):** no visible Diagnostics entry and no check widget in release builds; no `print`; the widget step log is debug-only; keep `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` (app and widget) in sync with any new data flow or required-reason API, and the privacy page in `site/` with it. App Store screenshots: run the manual **Screenshots** workflow.
- **Data on the device only:** saved designs and photos go only through `SharedStore` (App Group if resolved, else the app container; ADR-015); other shared files through `FileProtection.write`. Secrets only in the Keychain.
- **Widget memory (~30 MB):** downscale images to the widget's pixel size before saving them to the App Group.
- **Live data (ADR-016):** the widget extension gets its own data (`WidgetStudioWidgets/WidgetData.swift`); never pass data from the app except through the store container (only shared with an App Group). Missing data shows a `DataGap` message, never sample numbers; only gallery previews, snapshot tests and the M1 test designs use `DataSnapshot.sample`.
- **Capabilities (ADR-027):** every live value and tap action lives in `Resources/Spec/capabilities.json`. Validators, AI schema, prompt, Use another AI, editor pickers and auto-wire are built from it; never list ids by hand. Adding one = a catalog entry plus its provider (`DeviceData.swift`, `DeviceState.kt`) or action (`WidgetIntents.swift`, `WidgetActions`, `ActionRouter.kt`). `CapabilityDriftTests` and `CapabilityCatalogTest` fail until both are done. A prompt or schema change means fresh files from `package-renders/ai-export`.
- **States (ADR-028):** a built-in look belongs in `stateSets` of the catalog, generated by `node scripts/state-art.mjs` (dot art as ASCII maps). Never draw a look that differs by state as fixed layers. A new binding that a state reads needs a provider like any other.
- **Android tap areas (ADR-028):** absolute insets only (`TapZones`), never start padding; `Content` must keep reading `Widgets.revision`, or a live Glance session won't redraw.
- **Auto-wire (ADR-027):** `AutoWire.swift` and `AutoWire.kt` are one behavior: change both and the shared vectors (`Fixtures/AutoWire/vectors.json`). Recorded replies in `docs/ai-eval/recorded` replay on every push against `docs/ai-eval/wiring-best.json`: a lower wiring score fails CI.
- **AI (D4, D6, ADR-018):** AI returns a JSON spec, never code; every reply is validated in AI mode with one retry; overlaps left after the retry are fixed locally (`AILayoutFix`) or open the editor with a warning, never no widget (ADR-022). Default models and provider specifics are in ADR-018 and ADR-022 (free vision presets from the eval); check provider docs before changing model IDs. Tests never use real keys or network (fixtures in `Tests/WidgetKitCoreTests/Fixtures/AI`, `-uiTestingStubAI` for UI tests). The widget extension never calls AI.
- **AI quality (ADR-019):** change the prompt or schema only with the AI eval: run the **AI eval** workflow (at most a few runs; free Gemini keys allow ~20 requests a day per model, so prefer `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` and wait a few minutes after 503s; compare models in one run with a comma-separated `model`, raise `pause` for OpenRouter `:free` models; the summary's Listed column checks IDs against the provider's live list — NVIDIA retires models with HTTP 410), download the `ai-eval` artifact and look at the side-by-side images. Gemini starts in JSON mode (its `responseSchema` hung in the eval); new layer types need validator, exported schema, AI schema, prompt and a test spec.
