# Android progress (M7, A2–A5 in one run)

Handoff note for this run: the owner asked for A2, A3, A4 and A5 in one go, with one signed APK (`[apk]`) at the end.

## Done
- **AI export (ADR-025):** `WidgetKitCore/Resources/Spec/ai/` holds the system prompt, the review prompt, both AI schemas, the import example and the prompt version, all built by Swift. `AIExportTests` fails when they're stale and writes fresh copies to `package-renders/ai-export`. Android reads them as `assets/spec/ai/`.
- **A2:**
  - Editor (`ui/Editor.kt`): live preview with tap-to-select, fields, theme, clock, glass, colors including outer, photo with downscale and the mono/halftone filter, undo/redo.
  - Layer editor (`ui/Layers.kt`).
  - My widgets: edit, rename, duplicate, delete, empty state.
  - Configuration screen: designs first, then templates, with search and light/dark.
  - Saving updates every placed widget (`Widgets.updateAll`).
- **A3** (`data/LiveData.kt`):
  - Open-Meteo weather; adhan-java prayer times (Egyptian method, Shafi) and the Qibla bearing.
  - Health Connect steps and sleep; battery.
  - In-widget tasbeeh (four adhkar, count per dhikr, advance at 33) and stopwatch.
  - Torch toggles directly; the other tiles open system panels.
  - Qibla compass screen (rotation vector sensor).
  - WorkManager refresh every 30 min.
- **A4** (`ai/`):
  - Gemini client (JSON mode, low thinking, iOS error mapping).
  - Key encrypted with an Android Keystore AES key.
  - Model field with suggestions.
  - Parser port: palette, contrast, card shapes, icon and shape-kind cleanup, color tokens, mode and overlap problems, one retry, then the local layout fix.
  - Pixel-based card detector (Vision isn't available) with the crop step and Create all.
  - Use another AI: copy instructions, share the crop through FileProvider, paste, open a file or share in.
- **A5:**
  - Onboarding: three pages and the permissions page.
  - Settings: data, display, tasbeeh list, Gemini, Qibla, language (API 33+), intro, privacy and support links.
  - The launcher icon is the LogoMark geometry.
- **Tests:** `DesignLogicTest` (validator on every template, spec writer round trip, design JSON, layer editing, tasbeeh, AI parsing and import, prompt, Gemini errors, synthetic detector image).

## Left
- Arabic copy reviewed in code (one spelling of ويدجت, as on iOS); check it on the device.
- Final `[apk]` commit, then the report to the owner.

## Differences from iOS
| Area | Android |
|---|---|
| Clocks | re-rendered each minute (no TextClock: it formats with locale digits) |
| Stopwatch in the widget | shows whole minutes (the widget redraws once a minute) |
| Icons | Material Symbols instead of SF Symbols |
| Focus data | none (no API) |
| Tiles | torch toggles; Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, dark mode etc. open the system panel |
| AI | Gemini only; the iOS review round is not ported |
| Detector | pixel regions instead of Vision |
| Tinted/Clear | not applicable (Android themes the icon only) |

## Interactive widgets (ADR-027)
| Area | Android |
|---|---|
| Media | Any player: NotificationListener + MediaSession, redrawn on change and every 15 s while playing |
| Volume | Direct, media and ringer |
| Switches | Torch, silent, rotation and Do Not Disturb direct (the last three after a one-time grant); Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, airplane, mobile data, dark mode and battery saver open their panel |
| Compass | One sensor reading per minute while the screen is on, only when a placed widget shows it |
| Reminders | Unsupported: Android has no shared store; a tap shows a hint |
| Sizes | Small, Medium, Large receivers; the original receiver is hidden from the picker and keeps placed widgets working |
